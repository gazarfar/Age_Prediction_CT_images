# Predicting age from CT scans
To promote reproducible research, the CT Age model was made available as free and open-source software after the publication of our paper "Deep learning-based age estimation from chest CT scans"(10.1007/s11548-023-02989-w).
Please email Ghazal Azarfar (azarfar.g@gmail.com) with any questions and to get access to the trained model.
